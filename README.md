# Would That I Could Use This Hammer

This is a little game I made in 5 days!

I started with the simple jumping tutorial from a Udemy Course on [2D Game Development in Unreal](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-2d-course/) because I was curious about how 2D works in UE, and then decided to flesh it out a little bit to learn and do the whole release thing.

Right now it's only a single short level, but I may add more in the future.

I am thankful for all the artists who put their work online for people like me to use.

And special thanks to Gabriel Martinez & Alina Labrador :)
